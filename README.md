# [Hola](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXatvzWAzLU) 👋

Name's Alex, Alex Unger. It sure was a fun way how he got into coding, but he's come a long way ever since.

Proud father of Fred, Husband and dog cuddler, avid climber and mediocre programmer, but above all ~trying to be~ being an ok dude. I like to believe that most of the code I produce should be under no license, for the betterment of this discipline and to encourage an argument.

Always looking for a climbing sparring partner 🧗🏼‍♂️ let's hang out!
